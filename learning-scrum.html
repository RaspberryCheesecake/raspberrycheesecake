                <p>I recently attended a Certified Scrum Master course taught by Tobias Mayer of <a href="https://www.adventureswithagile.com/">Adventures With Agile</a>. I really enjoyed the course and the style in which it was taught. There was no death by Powerpoint! Tobias actually constructed a board on the wall with columns to keep track of the tasks comprising the course, and we added extra task cards for further discussion and questions as we went along. </p>
<p><img alt="The board" src="./images/scrum-course-scrum-board.jpg">
Here's what the board looked like near the start of the two day course.</p>
<p>We held 'Sprints' of an hour or so at a time, diving into aspects of Agile and then reviewing how it went, to improve our group process. Sometimes the teacher would stand and talk about a concept for a while, but mostly the course was interactive, especially during the second day where we broke out into groups for longer sessions. </p>
<p>The exercises we did included 'Point and Go': a game where players stand in a circle and have to 
<em> Point to someone else whose place you want to take
</em> Wait for them to say "Go"
<em> Start moving forwards to them
</em> Before you reach them, they have to find another place to go (and the cycle continues!)
This was unexpectedly hard! It was a metaphor for how difficult it can be to break out of an established pattern of behaviour at work. Even once we got into a rhythm, if things sped up or someone panicked, our orderly pattern fell apart.</p>
<p>Another exercise I enjoyed was coming up with different metaphors for Scrum. We broke out into groups and thought up some different ideas - I was impressed by the variety and how each of them fitted different parts of what Scrum can look like. Some of my favourites were:
<em> a garden growing and changing over time
</em> a cocktail bar developing new drinks
<em> a stand-up comedian working on their routine
</em> a graffiti crew making a work of art for their neighbourhood
* Jurassic Park (this was mine!)</p>

<p>Following the training, I'm a Certified Scrum Master. There have been <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2009/03/more-on-scrum-certification-test">some intelligent criticisms</a> of this certification process, including by some of its founders. The fact that there is a certification exam seems to somewhat devalue the training experience itself. I didn't really need to complete the training to do the certification exam - its questions are purely based on the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide">Scrum Guide</a> and a few on the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. How well can a multiple-choice test about a short document really hope to measure someone's competence in such a fuzzy relationship-centred domain as taking on the role of a Scrum Master? It's always going to fall short, I think. I've acted as a Scrum Master for several years already without the certification, so I was interested to see what it covered and didn't touch on.</p>
<p>I passed the exam. But the things that will really stay with me are the advice of the trainer and the discussions I had during the course, especially with others whose companies are also on the path to adopting more Agile practices. I certainly recommend Tobias as a teacher: his creative exercises and the way he presented the course helped grow my understanding and confidence in the role of Scrum Master. I'd like to attend his <a href="https://tobiasmayer.uk/scrum/smclinics">Scrum Master Clinic</a> - I think it will really help to have that ongoing mentoring and peer advice.</p>
