                <p>This is a write-up of a workshop I've given at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG/events/263945805/">CamPUG</a> and <a href="https://2019.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK 2019</a>. It was a lot of fun to deliver, and my participants came away with their own mini-games written in Ren'Py. I was impressed by the range of creative stories, everything from getting lost in Cardiff, storming Area 51, coaxing a grumpy cat, visiting a music festival, going to space, defeating animated fleas, visiting every pub in Cambridge, a child's guide to the Divine Right of Kings, interactive graffiti and more!</p>
<p>I hope this post will be useful as a reference for workshop participants and those who couldn't make it along.</p>
<h2>What is Interactive Fiction?</h2>
<p>You might be familiar with the concept of interactive fiction from "Choose Your Own Adventure" books. </p>
<p>Ever since computers came on the scene there has been interactive fiction here, too. <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork">Zork</a>, one of the earliest examples, is a dungeon-crawling game where the player explores The Great Underground Empire by typing text commands.</p>
<p>Using later tools like <a href="https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment">Parchment</a> and <a href="https://twinery.org/wiki/start">Twine</a> people are still creating these text-based interactive fiction games. A text-based game I've enjoyed recently is <a href="http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition2002%2Fzcode%2Fmoonlit%2FMoonlit.z5">Moonlit Tower</a> by sci-fi author Yoon Ha Lee.</p>
<p>Visual Novels are a genre of interactive fiction that combines pictures and text as a storytelling tool. They originated in Japan and many famous examples such as <em>Fate/Stay Night</em> and <em>Symphonic Rain</em> are Japanese. These games are often romance or relationship-themed, each path perhaps leading to a relationship with a different character.</p>
<h2>Ren'Py</h2>
<p><img alt="Ren'Py Icon" src="../images/renpy-icon.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://renpy.org">Ren'Py</a> is a visual novel creation engine written in Python. It has its own syntax and style, but also allows you to embed pure Python for more complex gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>It is cross-platform and works on Mac, Linux and Windows. All that you need alongside it is a simple text editor that can convert tabs to spaces, such as gedit.</p>
<h2>What can you do in Ren'Py?</h2>
<h4>Label Jump For Branching Stories</h4>
<p><img alt="Road Not Taken Screenshot" src="../images/road_not_taken.png"></p>
<p>I would humbly suggest my own game <a href="https://github.com/RaspberryCheesecake/RoadNotTaken">The Road Not Taken</a> as a useful introduction to the <code>label</code> / <code>jump</code> mechanic. Take a look in the <code>script.rpy</code> file to follow how the game works. It demonstrates how menus work in the game and how you can use them to move to different choices, similar to a GOTO statement. It also includes an example of embedding music within gameplay to add a mood to a scene. Feel free to copy and modify it as a basis for your own games.</p>
<h4>Custom GUI</h4>
<p><img alt="Hotel Shower Knob Screenshot" src="../images/Hotel_Shower_Knob_gameplay.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://yossarianiii.itch.io/ho">Hotel Shower Knob</a>, a game where you have to puzzle out an unfamiliar hotel bathroom to take a shower, is a good example of a custom GUI. Inside <code>options.rpy</code> the creator replaced the usual cursor with a custom image of a hand:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## The mouse clicker thingy.

define config.mouse = { &#39;default&#39; : [ (&#39;cursor.png&#39;, 66, 95)] }
</pre></div>


<p>This makes for a unique visual experience. As the hand is Creative-Commons licenced, you could use it in your own games, too!</p>
<h4>Embedded Python</h4>
<p><img alt="Two Worlds Screenshot" src="../images/two-worlds-screenshot.png"></p>
<p>Because Ren'Py is written in Python (2.7, if you're interested) it's easy to embed Python statements within it to acheive more complex effects such as creating mini-games. There are two ways to do this - prefixing single lines with <code>$</code> or using an indented block with the <code>python:</code> statement. I used <code>python:</code> statements within Ren'Py to create <code>Card</code> objects for my game <a href="https://github.com/RaspberryCheesecake/TwoWorldsGame/blob/master/game/script.rpy#L22">Two Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>The key thing to notice is the definition of the <code>Card</code> class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Define the card objects used to play the games with
init:
    python:

        flowers = [&quot;card-front-land-flower%d.png&quot; % i for i in range(1, 3)]

        class Card(object):
            def __init__(self):
                self.face_up = False
                self.selected = False
                self.number = 0
                self.coords = [0, 0]
                self.back = &quot;card-back-land.png&quot;
                self.front = flowers[0]
                self.paired = False

            @property
            def coord_text(self):
                return &quot;{}, {}&quot;.format(self.coords[0], self.coords[1])
</pre></div>


<p>This happens during the <code>init:</code> block, before the game starts, so it is available from the beginning. I subsequently used this in the <code>sea_game.rpy</code> and <code>land_game.rpy</code> files using the <code>ui.interact()</code> statement and <code>action If</code> to connect it with Ren'Py responses to on-screen clicks.</p>
<h4>Persistent Data</h4>
<p>Another useful trick is the ability to store persistent data between plays of the game. </p>
<p><img alt="Example From Long Live The Queen" src="../images/llq-ss3.jpg">
<em>An example from Long Live The Queen</em></p>
<p>This allows more satisfying gameplay such as unlocking new routes after a complete playthrough, and keeping track of player stats like Strength or Skill. Anything that can be <code>pickled</code> is suitable for this treatment. A simple example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if persistent.secret_unlocked:
        scene secret_room
        e &quot;I see you&#39;ve played before!&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>To unlock this path the user must hit a piece of code that sets <code>$persistent.secret_unlocked = True</code></p>
<p><code>persistent</code> is a special keyword in Ren'Py, so you shouldn't use it for anything else. Unlike other variables, if you haven't yet initialised it when you reach the if statement Ren'Py won't complain.</p>
<h2>Useful sources of free images and sounds for your games</h2>
<p>There are various community projects to collect images and sound to use in games with Creative Commons or similar licences.</p>
<p>I've found <a href="www.pxhere.com">px here</a> a useful collection of images, particularly photos.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://fraqtive.mimec.org/">Fraqtive</a> to create the card images and backgrounds for Two Worlds.</p>
<p>Useful sound sources include <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org">Free Music Archive</a> and for sound effects, <a href="https://freesound.org/">Free Sound</a></p>

                    <a href="../learning-scrum.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Agile Workshop&quot;">Agile Workshop</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I recently attended a Certified Scrum Master course taught by Tobias Mayer of <a href="https://www.adventureswithagile.com/">Adventures With Agile</a>. I really enjoyed the course and the style in which it was taught. There was no death by Powerpoint! Tobias actually constructed a board on the wall with columns to keep track of the tasks comprising the course, and we added extra task cards for further discussion and questions as we went along. </p>
<p><img alt="The board" src="../images/scrum-course-scrum-board.jpg">
<em>Here's what the board looked like near the start of the two day course.</em></p>
<p>We held 'Sprints' of an hour or so at a time, diving into aspects of Agile and then reviewing how it went, to improve our group process. Sometimes the teacher would stand and talk about a concept for a while, but mostly the course was interactive, especially during the second day where we broke out into groups for longer sessions. </p>
<p>The exercises we did included 'Point and Go': a game where players stand in a circle and have to </p>
<ul>
<li>Point to someone else whose place you want to take</li>
<li>Wait for them to say "Go"</li>
<li>Start moving forwards to them</li>
<li>Before you reach them, they have to find another place to go (and the cycle continues!)
This was unexpectedly hard! It was a metaphor for how difficult it can be to break out of an established pattern of behaviour at work. Even once we got into a rhythm, if things sped up or someone panicked, our orderly pattern fell apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another exercise I enjoyed was coming up with different metaphors for Scrum. We broke out into groups and thought up some different ideas - I was impressed by the variety and how each of them fitted different parts of what Scrum can look like. Some of my favourites were:</p>
<ul>
<li>a garden growing and changing over time</li>
<li>a cocktail bar developing new drinks</li>
<li>a stand-up comedian working on their routine</li>
<li>a graffiti crew making a work of art for their neighbourhood</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (this was mine!)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A Product Owner is like a Duchess" src="../images/scrum-roles-mindmap.jpg">
<em>A mindmap from my notes about the different Scrum roles</em></p>
<p>Following the training, I'm a Certified Scrum Master. There have been <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2009/03/more-on-scrum-certification-test">some intelligent criticisms</a> of this certification process, including by some of its founders. The fact that there is a certification exam seems to somewhat devalue the training experience itself. I didn't really need to complete the training to do the certification exam - its questions are purely based on the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide">Scrum Guide</a> and a few on the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. How well can a multiple-choice test about a short document really hope to measure someone's competence in such a fuzzy relationship-centred domain as taking on the role of a Scrum Master? It's always going to fall short, I think. I've acted as a Scrum Master for several years already without the certification, so I was interested to see what it covered and didn't touch on.</p>
<p>I passed the exam. But the things that will really stay with me are the advice of the trainer and the discussions I had during the course, especially with others whose companies are also on the path to adopting more Agile practices. I certainly recommend Tobias as a teacher: his creative exercises and the way he presented the course helped grow my understanding and confidence in the role of Scrum Master. I'd like to attend his <a href="https://tobiasmayer.uk/scrum/smclinics">Scrum Master Clinic</a> - I think it will really help to have that ongoing mentoring and peer advice.</p>
