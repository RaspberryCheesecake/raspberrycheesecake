                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Last night I went to the first of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/">Cambridge Programmers' Study Group</a> new sessions - we're starting to work through the book <a href="http://computationbook.com/">'Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs'</a> by Tom Stuart. The book uses practical exercises in Ruby to explain a bunch of theoretical computer science stuff, working up to cellular automata, Turing machines and the lambda calculus (exciting!). As Stuart's blurb explains, the book is aimed at</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An audience of working programmers without assuming any academic background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, people like me.  It sounded like exactly the sort of thing I should be learning, since I don't have a Computer Science background.</p>
<p>One small problem - very few of us in the group actually knew any Ruby! So we spent this session trying to teach ourselves using the examples in the first chapter. It was fun trying to pick up a new language in the company of other people - a lot more companionable than noodling around on your own, and easier to find out cute things about the language because if one person discovered something cool, they shared it with the group. This post will be about some of my first impressions of Ruby.</p>
<h2>Getting Ruby set up</h2>
<p>For those like myself who prefer more instructions than 'download Ruby online!' here's how I did it in the end:
<code>` $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full</code> which on my Ubuntu system downloaded Ruby 2.3, which was just fine for my needs. If you use Windows or Mac I'm told the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/">instructions on the Ruby-lang website</a> are quite helpful and up-to-date. I first tried using the default terminal, irb, which you call from the command line</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@device:~$ irb
irb(main):001:0&gt; 1+2
=&gt; 3
</pre></div>


<p>This works fine for the first few exercises, but I couldn't get auto-indentation to work, important for writing multi-line programs! I tried tinkering around with adding a <code>.irbrc</code> file with <code>require 'irb/completion'</code> as recommended in the comments of the main <code>irb.rb</code> file (which I found in <code>/usr/lib/ruby/2.3.0</code>). This didn't help - perhaps I put the config file in the wrong place? I ended up just using a slightly different terminal, pry, which was recommended by a colleague at the Meetup. It does auto-indentation and colour-coding too, which was very helpful! I don't think I'll be going back to irb. To install that, I just did <code>$ gem install pry</code> (gem is Ruby's package manager). To start using it, just type <code>pry</code> in the command line. </p>
<h2>Ruby is like Python</h2>
<p>Ruby is similar to Python in a lot of ways - this almost hindered me as I kept getting confused between Python and Ruby syntax. It felt like trying to learn Spanish when I already knew some French - confusingly close but distinct. I think ultimately this is helpful (I was mentally translating some things to Python to understand them, and that worked quite well) but to start with it was rather confusing.</p>
<p>Some similarities: <code>yield</code> sort of works the same</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">do_thrice</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="n">yield</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="n">yield</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="n">yield</span>
<span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">end</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="n">do_thrice</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">do_thrice</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">puts</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="no">Hello</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="o">!</span>
<span class="no">Hello</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="o">!</span>
<span class="no">Hello</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="o">!</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">nil</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And the string formatting works <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings">rather like Python 3.6's new f-strings</a>. So for instance, in Ruby <code>"#{x*2} and also #{y+1}"</code> gives you a string that calculates &amp; inserts those values.</p>
<p>The <code>*</code> operator works in similar ways to unpack elements of an iterable - for instance, you can do fun things like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Ruby is not like Python</h2>
<h4>Objects! Objects everywhere!</h4>
<p><a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/09/27/almost-everything-is-an-object-and-everything-is-almost-an-object/">(Almost) everything is an object in Ruby</a>, and it made me realise how I usually write Python in a fairly un-Object Oriented style. I generally avoid writing classes if I can help it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">especially classes which only contain two methods, one of which is <strong>init</strong></a> but this isn't really possible in Ruby. I suppose it's good for my soul - having a language that forces you into object-oriented thinking must make you confront what that really means. That's why there are these little <code>=&gt; nil</code> statements scattered around my code examples, by the way - irb and pry always shows you what object your statements evaluate to, and often that's <code>nil</code>, which is the object representing nothing - the 'empty' object, if you're mathematically minded.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to go read those books on Design Patterns after all...</p>
<h4>It's super-terse</h4>
<p>If Python cares a lot about preventing programmers having to type unecessary characters (goodbye <code>;</code> I didn't miss you) then Ruby cares even more. There are a lot of things you can do in one line. Here's a good one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">|</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">even</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This creates a <code>range</code> which spans the numbers 1 to 10, then looks at all the numbers in that range and, if they are even, adds them to a list and returns the list. Phew!</p>
<p>At times, this can be confusing - for instance, there's no need to write explicit <code>return</code> statements if you don't want to. By default, Ruby returns the evaluation of the last statement in the body of a method. For instance,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">what_do_i_return</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="s">&quot;A&quot;</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="s">&quot;B&quot;</span>
<span class="o">*</span>   <span class="s">&quot;or C?&quot;</span>
<span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">end</span>  
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="n">what_do_i_return</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">what_do_i_return</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;or C?&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You <em>can</em> write explicit return statements, but you don't have to. And the way to get a function to evaluate to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5267412/can-ruby-return-nothing">sort-of-nothing</a> is to explicitly return nil (of course!). This returning-by-default is confusing at first, but it seems to fit with the rest of Ruby's style.</p>
<h4>'nil' isn't <em>really</em> nothing</h4>
<p>You can put <code>nil</code> into things, which is hella confusing. For instance, suppose you have an array, you can add nil elements to it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">nil</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;surprising behaviour&quot;</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;surprising behaviour&quot;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_array</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;surprising behaviour&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Assigning to an element beyond the length of the array inserts nils until it reaches that element index (which didn't exist before!) and then it bungs in the thing you assigned. Intriguing!</p>
<h2>Some gripes</h2>
<h4>'Monkey patching'</h4>
<p>Monkey patching is <em>dangerous</em>. It's the way Ruby programmers refer to the ability to dynamically modify classes 'live' - at any time. You can even do this with Ruby's built-in classes, like String. At first glance it sounds really cool - you can just go define a new class method whenever you like! For instance</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nb">String</span>
<span class="o">*</span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">shouty</span>
<span class="o">*</span>        <span class="n">upcase</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;!!!&quot;</span>
<span class="o">*</span>    <span class="n">end</span>
<span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>adds a new 'shouty' method to strings. So now any string can use .shouty, just as if it were a built-in method</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shouty</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;HELLO!!!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But here's the thing - monkey patching can break things really easily - <strong>and Ruby won't warn you about it!</strong> One of the guys sitting next to me at the meet-up managed to break his irb's Array class by redefining some of its built-in methods. Especially if you're new to Ruby and don't know all the built-in class names, it's really easy to <em>accidentally</em> monkey patch your way into disaster. It seems like a really powerful feature, but I'm not happy with how it seems to work. Perhaps with a nice Ruby IDE that reminds you about all the classes you have on-the-go, it's easier to avoid horrible mistakes?</p>
<h4>CONSTANTS - why even bother?</h4>
<p>'Constants' are sort-of a thing in Ruby. If you define a variable with CAPITAL LETTERS, the Ruby interpreter will give you a warning. But it won't do anything about the warning - it'll still change the 'constant' value, and just complain about it. Here's an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">CONST</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Don&#39;t change me please&quot;</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Don&#39;t change me please&quot;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">CONST</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;I changed you anyways!!&quot;</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pry</span><span class="p">):</span><span class="mi">224</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">warning:</span> <span class="n">already</span> <span class="n">initialized</span> <span class="n">constant</span> <span class="no">CONST</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pry</span><span class="p">):</span><span class="mi">223</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">warning:</span> <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="n">definition</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="no">CONST</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="n">here</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;I changed you anyways!!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What's the <em>point</em> of having this feature? Can we perhaps write larger programs that will catch this warning and not change the constant (well, and change it back, since we warn but change things anyway)? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/660737/can-you-ask-ruby-to-treat-warnings-as-errors">Basically not at all</a>, apparently! I'm happy to be enlightened by some Ruby-god but as far as I can tell, this feature does nothing except confuse people used to programming in languages where constants exist and are, well, constant.</p>
<h1>Overall Impressions</h1>
<p>I found that during the session I fluctuated between delight ("what a nice way to do that!") and terror/annoyance as things behaved in unexpected ways. It has some peculiarities that particularly stand out to me in comparison with Python, and some features that are just adorably cute. I've been noodling around with it on and off all day today, and still enjoying getting to know it. Overall I'd say it's been fun! I can't say that I'm dying to use it as my new scripting language, but I'll certainly be pleased to become better acquainted as we work our way through the Computation book.</p>
<h4>PS</h4>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">RedGate</a> for hosting the session and feeding pizza to 20+ hungry programmers!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I was looking back through my mindmaps and came across this one, which I made when I first read "The Clean Coder" by 'Uncle' Bob Martin. I remember the book fondly and thought it might be fun to do a proper review.</p>
<p><img alt="My mindmap of The Clean Coder" src="./images/clean-coder.jpg"></p>
<h1>Overall Impressions</h1>
<p>The Clean Coder is a great read - Martin is a legend for a reason and his writing style is compelling, fun and readable. As the subtitle of my mindmap says, it's great! The book surprised me because it's not really about the mechanics of writing good code - it's all about professionalism (the 'clean' part) and having a set of ethics as someone who works in software. Martin uses some funny and horrifying war stories from his experiences as a novice programmer-for-hire to flesh out the book and explain what can happen when you don't have robust professionalism in your practice. I found myself nodding along as he described the team dynamics behind giving bad time estimates for completing a project, and how one of the most professional things you can do is sometimes to say "no" to tasks. </p>
<p><img alt="Yoda and Robert Martin have a lot in common" src="./images/frowny-yoda.png">
<strong>There is no "try".</strong></p>
<p>He also has some very insightful things to say about the dark side of 'Agile' practices, and how driving too hard toward a goal just-this-once is never a good idea. If nothing else, he points out, it doesn't even get you what you wanted! The code produced in those sort of conditions is invariably horribly flawed "3am code" and/or turns out to solve the wrong problem because those creating it were too busy trying to push something out the door to pay attention to the changing needs of their client. I'm reminded of <a href="http://onfoodandcoding.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/time-value-and-dark-side-of-agile.html">this blog post from On Food and Coding</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a given division of labour and a given level of skill, the proprietor can keep more money for themselves if they can get their staff to work for longer each day or to work with greater intensity. And when we deconstruct the terminology used by the most popular Agile process, Scrum, we find an unfortunate allusion to work at a greater intensity. For example, the week-by-week cycle of development is called an "iteration" in practically every other software process, including Extreme Programming. In Scrum this time period is called a Sprint. What associations does that conjure up? Well when you sprint you make an extreme effort to go as fast as possible, an effort that you can only keep up for a short time. That's what "sprint" means in everyday life. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin viscerally describes the sort of race-to-the-bottom conditions that this, coupled with optimistic overestimation of one's own ability to finish tasks, can induce.</p>
<h1>Some reservations</h1>
<p>One thing I disagree with is the amount of time he suggests allotting to your own personal practice - pairing with new people, doing Code Katas, listening to podcasts on software, picking up a new language, generally honing your craft. I absolutely think it's important to make sure you do some of this stuff outside of work - one of the reasons I started this blog is to motivate myself to learn more by providing a place to write about what I'm learning and have some accountability. But the time he suggests blocking out (<em>20 hours!</em>) is just unrealistic for most people. I think this very high bar is more likely to discourage would-be software folks from jumping into the field. I think understanding more about Martin's background explains where this comes from - he has a typically American 'Sleep is for the Weak!' attitude which has only <em>partly</em> been mollified by his realisation that if you work for too long, you stop producing things of worth because you're unable to concentrate well enough. Martin doesn't quite go far enough with his observations on 'Focus manna' to encompass leisure-time programming as well. Following his arguments, I have limited time in the week to practice my craft before I'm too tired for it to be of use - and I'm sure that line falls in different places for different people.</p>

                <p>I listened to a great talk recently called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9pEzgHorH0?feature=player_embedded&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;autoplay=1&amp;rel=0&amp;start=20">Stop Using Classes</a> by Peter Diedrich. The talk goes through some of the unhelpful ways classes can be used in Python and makes good points about readability and simplicity. Here's my mindmap of the talk.

<h2>Game of Life</h2>
<p>Diedrich uses as an example a neat implementation of Conway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> which is beautifully straightforward and avoids the tempting trap of making a class for a Cell, a class for a Board, etc. His example is so small I've copied and annotated it here (renamed a few of the variables for extra clarity):</p>

<p>What <code>friends</code> does requires some unpacking. First of all, <code>*map(neighbours, board)</code> takes the iterable returned from <code>map(neighbours, board)</code> and returns it. The <code>*</code> is a useful way to split up the returned single thing from <code>map</code> into each piece and feed them separately to the <code>chain()</code> function as arguments. Here's an example of <code>*</code> in action:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def hallo(arg1, arg2):
     print(arg1)
     print(arg2)
     print(&quot;Hallo!!&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; printme = (&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Indeed&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hallo(printme)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.5/code.py&quot;, line 91, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File &quot;&lt;input&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: hallo() missing 1 required positional argument: &#39;arg2&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; hallo(*printme)

Hallo!!

<p>This <code>map()</code> iterable is the function <code>neighbours()</code> applied to every point in <code>board</code>. So <code>map(neighbours, board)</code> returns sets of all the live cells' neighbours. This is used as an argument to the <code>chain()</code> function. What <code>chain()</code> does is glues groups of iterable things together into a <code>chain</code> object. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span>

<p>So it bungs all the sets of neighbours into one single set. Because of how Python sets work, this gets rid of any duplicate points - eg points which neighbour a couple of living cells should still only be mentioned once.</p>
<p><code>|</code> is just Python's binary OR operator - so <code>cells_we_care_about</code> is a set which contains all points that are in the list of live cells OR the list of their neighbours</p>
<p><code>count</code> counts neighbours for each living and dead cell. Diedrich then applies the rules for Conway's Game of Life in one line: 
<em> A dead cell that has 3 live neighbours becomes alive
</em> A live cell that has 2 live neighbours remains alive
* Every other cell dies.</p>
<h2>Sets are awesome</h2>
<p>One of the reasons his implementation is so tidy and has so few lines is his great use of <code>set()</code>, one of the built-in Python types. Sets are particularly great for this problem because they contain only unique elements - if you try to add multiples of the same element to a set you only end up with one in there. This means any duplicate points are eliminated without having to think about it. </p>
<p>For more examples of how to get good use out of Python's built-ins I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyDLAutA88s">Built in Super Heroes</a> by the excellent Dave Beazley. </p>

                <p>I decided to make a personal website a while back, to play around with web stuff for the first time. Taking the path of least resistance I used Github Pages - they give you a free 'Personal' static website which is rather nice. I cobbled together some CSS and HTML and made something that looked as if it had emerged from the 90s. It was perfectly fine for what I wanted to do, which was host little JavaScript games I was playing with writing - I had never written JavaScript before and wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to make this website into a blogging platform, and make it look a bit better, too. Rather than hand-coding everything from scratch (and still having something that looks as if it emerged from the 90s), I wanted to start out with something I can modify for myself with only a bit of effort. </p>
<p>I explored a bewildering range of different static website generators, trying to work out what I should use. According to <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">this list</a> there are over 100 of these out in the wild now! Even narrowing myself down to only the Python flavours (on the theory that I want to be able to tinker deeply with the webpages I create) left me with far too much to choose from. So I asked around friends and on the advice of <a href="http://mcla.ug">Hannah McLaughlin</a> I went for Pelican.</p>
<p>Getting Pelican up and running was not as easy as the docs would like you to believe (ah, if only...). So as nearly all first-time Pelican users must do, if the examples in the <a href="www.pelicanthemes.com">Pelican Themes</a> page are anything to go by, my first blog post here will be a tutorial - mostly for my own reference - on how to use Pelican. I found that <a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html">Amy Hanlon's post on the subject</a> was most helpful, as she doesn't tend to assume any 'obvious' prior knowledge from the reader.</p>
<h1>First Steps</h1>
<p>In the terminal, set up a new virtual environment for all your Pelican business (good practice). Then make a directory for the website and initialise Pelican in there. These steps went without incident.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkvirtualenv pelican
setvirtualenvproject
workon pelican

pip install pelican
pip install Markdown
mkdir Website
cd Website
pelican-quickstart
</pre></div>


<p>Pelican's quickstart does allow you to get off the ground pretty fast by setting things up the way you'd like after asking a series of questions. There was an option to say I wanted to upload my site using GitHub Pages - perfect. Say 'yes' to <code>auto-reload &amp; simple HTTP script to assist with developing theme</code> and to <code>create Fabfile/Makerfile</code>. It spits out some basics:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>content            Makefile        pelicanconf.pyc
develop_server.sh  output          publishconf.py
fabfile.py         pelicanconf.py  
</pre></div>


<p><code>pelicanconf.py</code> is where your local configuration sits - that's what you want to alter when you're tweaking the webpages you display. <code>publishconf.py</code> is the file that deals with published web pages, eg analytics etc - we're not going to mess with that. <code>content</code> is the folder where you bung all your Markdown (.md) or reStructuredText (.rst) files for all those great blog posts. Pelican will also recognise the folder names <code>images</code> and <code>pages</code> automatically - these are where your pictures and the different webpages you create (aside from the blog posts) will go. <code>output</code> is the folder where the final CSS and HTML live, and it's the part that should be posted to wherever you're doing your web hosting.</p>
<h1>Problem 1 - no Themes</h1>
<p>I try and host my new website locally to see what it looks like - and it looks like crap! It's because I don't have any of the lovely themes loaded. I try exactly what the Pelican Themes page recommends: <code>git clone themes into ~/home/user/pelican-themes</code> and add a line in the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> file, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>THEMES = &quot;/home/user/pelican-themes/blue-penguin&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Sanity check: do I have any themes installed?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(pelican)sandmanuser@sandman-VirtualBox:~/Website$ pelican-themes -l
notmyidea
simple
</pre></div>


<p>No. How strange. I did clone pelican-themes locally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes
</pre></div>


<p>But since I didn't clone <code>--recursive</code>ly, the actual configuration files for each theme weren't copied. When I go in and look, it's just a bunch of empty folders. Yes, because now when I try to clone it takes <em>forever</em>! Now we're cooking on gas, and when I run <code>make html</code> and then <code>make serve</code> I see that it's looking pretty. Ctrl+C stops the server.</p>
<h1>Problem 2 - not updating local server</h1>
<p>I discover what must be another common problem - I go change a webpage to try something else out, hit <code>make serve</code> and find that it won't run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use
Makefile:77: recipe for target &#39;serve&#39; failed
make: *** [serve] Error 1
</pre></div>


<p>Woops! Looks like I didn't actually switch off the server I made to try things out - it was still running in the background. It turns out the nicest way of dealing with this is to use the shell script they've kindly made for you - just run
<code>./develop_server.sh start</code> and <code>./develop_server.sh stop</code>
to start the development server and stop it again nicely. This also updates your webpages locally live - as soon as you make and save a change to them, the development server updates your webpage so you can see how things look in real time.</p>
<h1>Why didn't you tell the world?</h1>
<p>So far this website is only working on a little server-in-a-bottle we've created in our own computer. Time to take it to the web! Since I'm hosting my site with GitHub Pages, my user site on GitHub is where I'm going to push the contents of my <code>output</code> folder to. </p>
<p>I'm going to create a separate repository for the rest so I can back up my Markdown files, tweak my Theme and rebuild the website from different computers.</p>
<p>This requires a little careful thought when it comes to <code>.gitignore</code> and how we refresh the <code>output</code> folder. </p>
<h1>And once you've gotten everything working...</h1>
<p>You might want to do a freeze to capture the packages you installed &amp; make it easier on yourself moving to another computer.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
